                <p>The National Conference of Environmental Doctoral Students on New Theories and New Technology of Environmental Science and Engineering (&ldquo;Environmental Conference for Doctoral Students&rdquo;), is held by Tsinghua University, Chinese Society for Environmental Sciences (Environmental Education Committee), Collaborative Innovation Center for Regional Environmental Quality, State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, sponsored by Xi&rsquo;an University of Architecture and Technology and <em>Frontiers of Environmental Science &amp; Engineering(Journal)</em>. Adhering to the purpose &ldquo;exchange and idea-collision towards a road of innovation, widely accumulate into remarkable words,&rdquo; the conference is themed &ldquo;New Theories and New Technology of Environmental Science and Engineering&rdquo;. It has actively been serving as a high-level academic platform for students from environmental and related disciplines.</p>
                <p>The annually held conference has so far witnessed 11 successful sessions. A total of 1913 abstracts were received, with a total of 1092 participants and 22 guests (including more than 10 academicians including Academician Qian Yi, Academician Hao Jiming, Academician Yang Zhifeng, Academician He Kebin, Academician Qu Jiuhui and etc.) Doctoral students from more than 100 domestic and foreign universities, including nearly half of the first-class universities and almost all universities with environmental science and engineering disciplines, covering over 30 related majors such as environmental science, environmental engineering, chemical engineering, municipal engineering, energy engineering, economic management, mechanical engineering, bioengineering, ecological engineering, nuclear science and technology. With the increasing popularity and influence, the &ldquo;Environmental Conference for Doctoral Students&rdquo; has been widely recognized by teachers and doctoral students from environmental field in China, and has gradually become the most influential platform of academic exchange for doctoral students who major in environmental sciences.</p>
                <p>During the conference, the doctoral students, as key players of the conference, not only undertook the main organizing work but also realized a new mode of &ldquo;self-moderation, discussion, summary and commentary&rdquo; which formed a high-level academic atmosphere for doctoral students. A variety forms of communication was adopted, including reports, poster displays, group sessions, seminars and academic salons. In order to improve its academic competence, each conference would invite scholarship winners to share their personal lessons and experience, including Qian Yi scholarship, national scholarship and comprehensive scholarship winner of Tsinghua University, all of such speeches are well received. During the academic exchange, conference organizers also hold exchange activities such as buffet reception, tour to Tsinghua University Art Museum, Olympic Park, Badachu and other attractions. These activities provide great opportunities for doctoral students to communicate, as well as improving their abilities to participate in academic exchange, which should be beneficial for expanding academic horizons, stimulating inspiration, inspiring scientific thinking and enhancing academic friendship.</p>
                <p>The 12th &ldquo;Environmental Conference for Doctoral Students&rdquo; will be held on October 18<sup>th</sup>-21<sup>st</sup>, 2018, at Tsinghua University (Beijing, China), with a focus on water pollution control and resource recycling, air pollution control, solid waste pollution control and recycling, environmental economics and management and policy, environmental chemistry and materials, environmental ecology and health, energy and climate change, etc. There are sub-venues for new theories and new technology in environmental science and engineering, at the same time, with a venue set in English for better international communications. The conference will collect papers and compile them into &ldquo;Proceedings of Environmental Conference for Doctoral Students&rdquo;, and award several excellent posters, outstanding reports and papers. Finally, some of the best papers selected for conference proceedings will have the opportunity to be published in SCI journals such as <em>Frontiers of Environmental Science &amp; Engineering</em> (IF = 1.716).</p>
                <p>In order to inherit and carry forward the fine tradition of the former 11 conferences, the 12th &ldquo;Environmental Conference for Doctoral Students&rdquo; will continue to create a good atmosphere for academic exchanges for doctoral students and will continuously provide a platform for PhD students to exercise their abilities and enhance their friendship.</p>
