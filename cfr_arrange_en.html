                <p>“Classics on Bamboo Slips” - Documentary Exhibition of Tsinghua Bamboo Slips</p>
                <img src="images/sightseeing/museum8.png" style="width:800px;">
                <p> “Tsinghua Bamboo slips” are the cultural relics unearthed from the tomb in Kingdom Chu in the middle Warring States Period in Chinese history, totaling approximately 2,500 pieces (including some broken ones). The total characters on them are nearly 60,000, primary about classics of Chinese literature and history. They were buried before the Qin Dynasty and fortunately escaped the great Confucian purge, which helped to preserve to the maximum extent the original appearance of the classics of Pre-Qin Period. They have high values for understanding the inception and development context of Chinese civilization as well as the study of shape and structure of bamboo slips and ancient characters.</p>
                <p>From Dithyrambe to Arcadia：Exhibition of Markus Lüpertz</p>
                <img src="images/sightseeing/museum9.png" style="width:800px;">
                <p>This exhibition presents Lüpertz’s work since 1968 with 104 artworks, including 88 paintings and 16 sculptures that reflect major periods in the artist’s oeuvre. The Dithyrambe series is his most important body of early painting, representing passion and fantasy. He worked on the Arcadia series for nearly ten years recently, and these images are bagged with wonderful imagined utopias. The movement from Dithyrambe to Arcadia is the elevation and evolution of Lüpertz’s personal artistic development, reflecting his great expectations for contemporary society and humanity. From the exhibition, we can see that his philosophical art style has continued even into Lüpertz’s recent works. He inspires us to build our own future Arcadias with our imaginations.</p>
